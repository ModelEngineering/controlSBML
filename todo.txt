New architecture
  0. Archive deprecated files and their tests
  1. More tests
  2. Remove initialization hack
  3. Add noise and disturbance
  4. Connect with other controlSBML features
  5. System ID for state space
  6. Better system ID signals. Random?

 metformin example 
 design algorithm: find design parameters that create a closed loop
    transfer function with low rmse
 effective noise rejection?
  1. Easily construct testbed and run it
     handling construction of initial state
     MIMO analysis
Convenience methods in ControlSBML
Update the course notebooks
  3. Document use of convenience methods: plotMIMOStaircaseResponse,
      fitMIMOTransferFunction, plotFitMIMOTransferFunction
Check all FIXME
