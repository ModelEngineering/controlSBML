  1. Resolve how to handle reduced order models. Keep? Delete?
Conserved moieties
  - Need right side null space of stoichiometry matrix
  - Construct the dependent matrix for C
    - A = Reduced_Stoichiometry * Flux_Jacobian
    - C = Right_Nullspace_Stoichiometry * Flux_Jacobian, where
      Right_Nullspace_Stoichimentry = getKMatrix()
  2. Inputs are always species, never fluxes. However, outputs can be fluxes.
  3. readthedocs
  4. Document IOSystemFactor, SISOClosedLoopSystem
  5. Resolve "FIXME"
