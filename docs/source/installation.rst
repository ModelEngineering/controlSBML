Installation
============

You need to install both ``controlSBML`` and the
the CalTech ``control`` package.
You can do this in a terminal window on Windows, Mac,
and Linux by entering the commands below.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install controlSBML
    pip install control

If you are in a Jupyter notebook, you should insert a ``!``
before ``pip``.

The code scripts in this documentation assumes
that the following statements appear before you run the scripts:

.. code-block:: python

    import control
    import controlSBML as ctl
