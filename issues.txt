1. Find strange bug with plotting. Might be related to the conda environment.
2. Eliminate or at least minimize the dependency on tellurium.
3. Provide convenience methods.
4. Simplified handling of state space models. The A matrix is the Jacobian
   at a user-specified simulation time (with 0 as the default).
5. Allow Boundary species as inputs.
6. plotDesign
    a. num_coordinate -> num_parameter_value
    b. k*_spec: 1 float is value; 3 float is upper and lower bound and num_parameter value; eliminate min_value, max_value, num_
